# PAnoptic Segmentation of satellite image TIme Series - PASTIS Benchmark

![](images/predictions.png)

## Dataset presentation
PASTIS is a benchmark dataset for panoptic and semantic segmentation of agricultural parcels from 
satellite image time series. It is composed of 2433 one square kilometer-patches in the French metropolitan territory for which sequences 
of satellite observations are assembled into a four-dimensional spatio-temporal tensor. 
The dataset contains both semantic and instance annotations, assigning to each pixel a semantic label and an instance id.
There is an official 5 fold split provided in the dataset's metadata.
## Usage 
- **DOWNLOAD** 

The dataset can be downloaded from [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5012942).
- **DATALOADER** 

This repository also contains a PyTorch dataset class in `code/dataloader.py` 
that can be readily used to load data for training.
- **METRICS** 

A PyTorch implementation is also given in `code/panoptic_metrics.py` to compute
the panoptic metrics. In order to use these metrics, the model's output should contain an instance prediction
and a semantic prediction. The first one allocates an instance id to each pixel of the image, 
and the latter a semantic label.
