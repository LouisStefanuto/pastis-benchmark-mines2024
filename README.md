# Mines 2024 Data Challenge

Welcome to the Mines x Invent 2024 Data Challenge! This repository is designed to help Mines Paris M2 students get started quickly with the challenge.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

First, you'll need to create a Python virtual environment. Make sure you're using Python 3.12:

```bash
conda create -n env_challenge python=3.12
conda activate env_challenge
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next, install the required dependencies for the project:

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install --with dev
```

## Dataset

The dataset for this challenge is quite large, but for initial experiments, we recommend starting with the mini dataset.

- **Mini Dataset**: Available on Kaggle in the [Data section](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-challenge-invent-mines2024/data).
- **Full Dataset**: Coming soon on Kaggle.

## Running the Demo

To get a quick start, check out the `demo.ipynb` notebook. It will guide you through loading and visualizing the dataset, helping you familiarize yourself with the data.
